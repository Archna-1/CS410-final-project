"and there does remain a gap between...the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we're seeing on the ground," he told a press conference.with most gazans now displaced and unable to access any aid, hospitals overrun and food running out, the main u.n. agency there said society was "on the verge of a full-blown collapse" and its ability to protect people there was "reducing fast".residents and the israeli military both reported intensified fighting in both northern areas, where israel had previously said its troops had largely completed their tasks last month, and in the south where they mounted a new assault this week.gaza's health ministry reported 350 people killed on thursday, and on friday it said the death toll from israel's campaign in gaza had risen to 17,487, with thousands more missing and presumed buried under rubble. more strikes were reported on friday morning in khan younis in the south, the nusseirat camp in the centre and gaza city in the north.on friday evening, residents reported intensified israeli tank fire on the districts of shejaia, nafaq, sabra and jala in north gaza, while health officials said at least 10 people were killed in an air strike on a house in khan younis.israel's military said 94 israeli soldiers had been killed fighting in gaza since its ground invasion of the densely populated, coastal enclave began in late october in retaliation for hamas' rampage in southern israel in which it killed 1,200 people and took 1,200 more than 240 hostages.an israeli commander, brig. gen. dan goldfuss, said in a video message recorded in khan younis that his forces were fighting house to house and "shaft to shaft", a reference to tunnel shafts. as he spoke, gunshots rang out in the background.'fear, hunger and cold'117a wounded palestinian child sits on the floor of nasser hospital following israeli strikes, amid the ongoing conflict between israel and palestinian islamist group hamas, in khan younis in the southern gaza strip, december 8, 2023. reutersibraheem abu mustafa  acquire licensing rightsisrael launched what it says is a campaign to destroy hamas after the islamist militant group's bloody oct. 7 cross-border raid.since then, most of gaza's 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes. with fighting now going on across both halves of gaza, residents say it has become almost impossible to find refuge.while the u.s. has backed humanitarian "pauses" in the fighting to allow for the release of hostages and delivery of aid, it has refused to join international calls for a ceasefire, saying that would only give hamas time to regroup and rearm.israel says it is providing detail about which areas are safe and how to reach them, and says hamas is to blame for harm that befalls civilians because it operates among them, an accusation the islamist group denies.hamas reported the most intense clashes with israeli forces were taking place in the north in shejaia, as well as in the south in khan younis, where israeli forces reached the heart of the enclave's second-biggest city on wednesday.israel's military said two of its troops were severely injured in an unsuccessful operation to rescue hostages held in gaza. it said "numerous terrorists" were killed.israel's chief military spokesperson rear admiral daniel hagari said israel had detained more than 200 suspects from gaza in the last 48 hours and that dozens of them were taken to israel for questioning, adding hamas commanders were among them.hamas' armed wing said it had thwarted an attempt to free a captured israeli soldier, which it said resulted in his death, and that israeli bombing over gaza had resulted in the death and injuries of other israeli hostages.reuters journalists in southern gaza have seen dead and wounded swamping the main nasser hospital in khan younis, where there was no room on the floor on friday for arriving patients sprawled across blood-smeared tiles."we are staying in an area that is, according to maps, a safe area," said mohamed al-amouri, adjusting an oxygen mask for his school-aged son who lay on a hospital bed in soccer shorts with his legs bandaged and his body lacerated."children were on the streets playing, living life normally... we went out after the hit, hearing screams, to find youth, children, women and men in body parts - among them martyrs dead and injured."residents reached by telephone elsewhere in gaza described similar scenes of desperation. with the fighting now going on in all directions, there was no place left to flee, said yamen, sheltering at a school in central gaza with his family."inside the school is like outside it: the same feeling of fear of near death, the same suffering of starvation," he said. "every day we say we somehow survived. but for how long?"the world food programme said it was becoming impossible to get supplies to hungry people in the gaza strip.in ramallah on the west bank, palestinian president mahmoud abbas told reuters an international peace conference was necessary to end the war and work out a lasting political solution leading to the establishment of a palestinian state.thomas white, gaza head of unrwa, the u.n. aid agency for palestinians, wrote on x: "civil order is breaking down in gaza - the streets feel wild, particularly after dark - some aid convoys are being looted and u.n. vehicles stoned."reporting by bassam masoud in gaza, nidal al-mughrabi in cairo, dan williams and henriette chacar in jerusalem, humeyra pamuk and simon lewis in washington, gabrielle tetrault-farber in geneva, michelle nichols in new york and reuters bureaux; witing by peter graff, william maclean and matt spetalnick; editing by angus macswan, mark heinrich and diane craftour standards: the thomson reuters trust principles. acquire licensing rights, opens new tabnidal al-mughrabithomson reutersa senior correspondent with nearly 25 years experience covering the palestinian-israeli conflict including several wars and the signing of the first historic peace accord between the two sides.read nextarticle with videomiddle eastcategoryisraeli tanks reach centre of khan younis in new storm of southern gazadecember 10, 2023article with gallerymiddle eastcategoryviolence escalates between israel, lebanon's hezbollahdecember 10, 2023middle eastcategoryun general assembly likely to vote tuesday on gaza ceasefire demand - diplomats12:59 am utcworldcategorynetanyahu speaks to putin, voices disapproval of iran tiesdecember 10, 2023more from reutersworldarticle with galleryblinken: israel should do more to protect gaza civiliansmiddle eastcategory  december 10, 2023u.s. secretary of state anthony blinken urged israel to do more to protect palestinian civilians in its war with hamas on sunday, as israeli tanks fought their way into the main city of the southern gaza strip.united kingdomcategoryuk property asking prices fall more than usual -rightmove12:07 am utcarticle with gallerycop28categorywhat to watch at cop28 on mondaydecember 10, 2023article with galleryafricacategorymoroccans, angry at attacks on gaza, demand halt to ties with israeldecember 10, 2023europecategorypoland could cancel contracts signed by outgoing govt, says parliament speakerdecember 10, 2023site indexbrowseworldbusinessmarketssustainabilitylegalbreakingviewstechnologyinvestigations, opens new tabsportssciencelifestyleabout reutersabout reuters, opens new tabcareers, opens new tabreuters news agency, opens new tabbrand attribution guidelines, opens new tabreuters leadership, opens new tabreuters fact check, opens new tabreuters diversity report, opens new tabstay informeddownload the app ios, opens new tabdownload the app android, opens new tabnewsletters, opens new tabinformation you can trustreuters, the news and media division of thomson reuters, is the worlds largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day. reuters provides business, financial, national and international news to professionals via desktop terminals, the world's media organizations, industry events and directly to consumers.follow usthomson reuters productswestlaw, opens new tabbuild the strongest argument relying on authoritative content, attorney-editor expertise, and industry defining technology.onesource, opens new tabthe most comprehensive solution to manage all your complex and ever-expanding tax and compliance needs.checkpoint, opens new tabthe industry leader for online information for tax, accounting and finance professionals.lseg productsworkspace, opens new tabaccess unmatched financial data, news and content in a highly-customised workflow experience on desktop, web and mobile.data catalogue, opens new tab browse an unrivalled portfolio of real-time and historical market data and insights from worldwide sources and experts.world-check, opens new tabscreen for heightened risk individual and entities globally to help uncover hidden risks in business relationships and human networks.advertise with us, opens new tabadvertising guidelines, opens new tabcoupons, opens new tabacquire licensing rights, opens new tabcookies, opens new tabterms of use, opens new tabprivacy, opens new tabdigital accessibility, opens new tabcorrections, opens new tabsite feedback, opens new taball quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes. see here for a complete list of exchanges and delays. 2023 reuters. all rights reserved
